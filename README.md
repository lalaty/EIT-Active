## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

0. [Java 8+][]: We use Java to run a development back-end server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install JAVA either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
   Therefore, u need to install Java SE Development Kit (JDK 8+) or Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE 8+).
   For more information, u can visit the Oracle website http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
    For Linux OS, I suggest these commands:

`    

     add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java 
     apt-get update 
     apt-get install oracle-java9-installer  `

1. [Install a Java build tool so called Gradle][]:Install a Java build tool.
    Go to the official Gradle website to do your own installation at http://www.gradle.org/
    For Linux OS, I suggest the following tutorial:
    How to Install Gradle on Ubuntu 16.10 for dummies:
     https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-gradle-on-ubuntu-16-10
2. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
   However, an LTS version is preferable.
   U can Install Node.js from the Node.js website: http://nodejs.org/ or u can foolow this tuto:
   https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-ubuntu/
3. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
   Install Yarn from the Yarn website: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
4. [NPM][]: We use also the node package manager(NPM) , you can install NPM either from source or 
   as a pre-packaged bundle. The NPM website: http://nodejs.org/
   To install NPM:
   `npm install -g npm`
5. [Bower][]: We use also bower, and to install it, `npm install -g bower `
6. [Gulp][]: We use also bower, to install it, `npm install -g gulp-cli`

Note: if you have problems to use these tools globally, be sure you have $HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin in your path.
export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`:$HOME/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/.bin"




After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    yarn install

We use yarn scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.


Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew
    yarn start

[Yarn][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `yarn update` and `yarn install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `yarn help update`.

The `yarn run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.




### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    yarn add --exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    yarn add --dev --exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:

Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css](src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~

Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts

## Building for production

To optimize the EITPortal application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in your browser.

###Credentials:
Username: admin
password: admin

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    yarn test



## Continuous Integration (optional)
### Configuring Eclipse to import the EIT Project
To get full Gradle support in eclipse you should install the buildship plugin : https://gradle.org/eclipse/.
#### Import EIT Project as a Gradle project:
Select File -> Import.<br />
Choose Gradle Project.<br />
Select EIT Project root directory.<br />
Click on Next and finish the wizard.<br />


#### Add apt generated source folder to build path
When using buildship gradles default outputfolder is filtered and not visible in your workspace. 
Therefore you need to remove it from eclipse’s resource filter setting.

Right click on your project and select Properties<br />
Select Resources<br />
Remove the entry build<br />
Select Java Build Path<br />
Click Add Folder...<br />
Check the path build/generated/source/apt/main<br />
